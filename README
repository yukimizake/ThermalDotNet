ThermalDotNet is a lightweight .Net library for ESC/POS thermal printers.

It requires Mono 2.10 or .Net 3.5.
I've only tested it with Mono, but it should work with .Net.

Features:

* Simple text and standard text styles supported. (Bold, double size, reverse printing...)
* Barcodes support
* Image printing support (must be 384px wide)
* Printer configuration support (heating time, speed, etc.)

To do:

* Custom characters support
* International encodings support
* Barcode text location & barcode height support
* Printing density support
